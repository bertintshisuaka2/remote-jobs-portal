**Netflix**  
Hiring Manager

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the **Full-Stack Software Engineer (L4), Revenue & Growth Tools Team** position at Netflix. With a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the University of Phoenix, completion of Georgia Tech's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, and QA Software Tester certification from JanBask Training, combined with 18+ years of professional experience in maintenance engineering, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team.

## Why I'm a Great Fit

My unique background bridges hardware and software engineering. During my 18 years as a Maintenance Engineer across 8+ companies, I developed strong problem-solving skills through:

- **PLC Programming**: Writing and debugging ladder logic and control systems
- **Electrical Troubleshooting**: Systematic diagnosis of complex technical issues  
- **Systems Optimization**: Improving efficiency and reliability of industrial automation
- **High-Pressure Performance**: Maintaining critical systems with minimal downtime

These skills translate directly to software developmentâ€”debugging code is remarkably similar to troubleshooting electrical systems, and PLC programming follows the same logical thinking as modern programming languages.

## Recent Technical Training

To transition into software development, I've completed:

- **Georgia Tech Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp (2023)**: Gained hands-on experience with React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, and modern web technologies
- **QA Software Tester Certification (2025)**: Learned testing methodologies, automation frameworks, and quality assurance best practices
- **Personal Projects**: Built multiple full-stack applications demonstrating proficiency in the MERN stack

## What I Bring to Netflix

- **Proven Work Ethic**: 18 years of consistent professional performance
- **Problem-Solving Mindset**: Experience diagnosing and resolving complex technical issues
- **Quick Learner**: Successfully transitioned from hardware to software engineering
- **Team Collaboration**: Worked effectively with cross-functional teams in industrial settings
- **Attention to Detail**: Critical for both electrical systems and clean, bug-free code

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my unique perspective and technical skills to Netflix. I am particularly drawn to this role because it aligns perfectly with my recent training and career transition goals.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my background and skills can contribute to your team's success.

Sincerely,

**KABUNDI Tshisuaka**
