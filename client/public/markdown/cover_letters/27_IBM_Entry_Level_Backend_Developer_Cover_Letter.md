**Hiring Manager**  
IBM Corporation  
Backend Development Team  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Entry Level Backend Developer position at IBM. With a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering, recent certifications in Full Stack Web Development and QA Software Testing, and a unique background combining 18+ years of complex systems engineering with modern software development skills, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to IBM's mission of building innovative, large-scale backend systems that deliver global impact.

IBM's reputation for technological excellence, collaborative culture, and commitment to solving the world's most challenging problems resonates deeply with my professional values and career aspirations. The opportunity to work alongside world-class engineers while developing backend solutions that serve users globally represents exactly the type of meaningful, high-impact work I am seeking as I transition my extensive technical experience into enterprise software development.

Throughout my career in industrial automation and maintenance engineering, I developed a strong foundation in the core competencies essential for backend development. Programming PLC systems using structured logic taught me algorithmic thinking and control flow design—skills that translate directly to writing clean, efficient backend code. Troubleshooting complex industrial systems under pressure honed my ability to quickly identify root causes and implement effective solutions, much like debugging production backend services. Managing mission-critical infrastructure instilled in me the importance of system reliability, monitoring, and proactive maintenance—principles that are fundamental to building robust backend systems.

Building on this foundation, I have invested intensively in modern software development through formal education and hands-on project work. I have designed and implemented RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js, creating secure endpoints with proper authentication, middleware, and error handling. I have built database-driven applications using SQL (PostgreSQL and MySQL), designing normalized schemas and writing complex queries to ensure data integrity and optimal performance. I have deployed applications to AWS cloud infrastructure, configuring EC2 instances, managing IAM permissions, and implementing CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. Additionally, my recent QA Software Testing certification has given me a quality-first mindset, ensuring that I write testable, maintainable code from the outset.

What sets me apart is my proven ability to master complex technical systems and apply systematic problem-solving approaches across different domains. My experience working with Linux-based industrial control systems, writing automation scripts in Bash, and managing critical infrastructure has prepared me to work confidently with the backend technologies and methodologies that IBM employs. I am proficient in Java, JavaScript, and SQL—core languages IBM seeks—and I have practical experience with Agile development practices through collaborative bootcamp projects and self-directed work.

I am particularly drawn to IBM's emphasis on collaboration, continuous learning, and career development. As someone who has successfully transitioned from industrial engineering to software development, I understand the value of mentorship, knowledge sharing, and working within diverse teams to achieve common goals. I am eager to contribute my unique perspective, strong work ethic, and technical skills to IBM's backend development initiatives while continuing to grow my expertise in enterprise-level software engineering.

The Entry Level Backend Developer role at IBM represents the ideal next step in my career journey—an opportunity to apply my technical foundation, problem-solving abilities, and passion for building reliable systems to create software that makes a real difference in the world. I am confident that my combination of software development skills, systems thinking, and proven ability to quickly master new technologies will enable me to contribute meaningfully to your team from day one.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasm for backend development align with IBM's needs. I am excited about the possibility of joining IBM and contributing to the innovative work your team is doing.

Sincerely,

**KABUNDI Tshisuaka**
