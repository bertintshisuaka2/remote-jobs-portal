## Translation of Skills: Automation to Software Development

The 18+ years of experience in industrial automation and maintenance engineering provides a robust foundation for a career in software development:

*   **Systems Thinking:** Deep experience in designing, implementing, and maintaining complex physical systems (PLCs, robotics, control loops) translates directly to architecting scalable and reliable software systems.
*   **Programming Logic:** PLC programming (Ladder Logic, Function Block Diagram) is a form of industrial programming that requires the same **logical thinking** and structured approach as writing code in **JavaScript** or Python.
*   **Troubleshooting & Debugging:** Electrical and mechanical diagnostics require a systematic, root-cause analysis approach—the same methodology used for identifying and resolving bugs in **backend development** and **full-stack applications**.
*   **Automation:** Experience in automating physical processes is directly applicable to continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) and workflow automation in a software development environment.
*   **High-Pressure Problem-Solving:** Consistently solving critical, time-sensitive problems in manufacturing environments demonstrates resilience and the ability to deliver under pressure, a vital skill in fast-paced product development teams.
