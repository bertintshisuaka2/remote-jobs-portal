## Professional Experience

### Senior Maintenance Engineer (Consolidated)
**Multiple Companies, USA** | **2007 â€“ Present**

Leveraged 18+ years of extensive experience in high-stakes manufacturing and industrial environments, applying systematic and logical approaches to maintain and optimize complex machinery and control systems.

*   **Systems Troubleshooting & Diagnostics:** Directed and executed complex **electrical troubleshooting and diagnostics** on critical production equipment, reducing downtime by an average of 15% through systematic root cause analysis and corrective action.
*   **Industrial Automation & Programming:** Designed, implemented, and maintained **Industrial Automation and Control Systems**, including extensive experience with **PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) programming**. This experience directly translates to writing clean, modular, and logical code for software applications.
*   **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Worked closely with production, engineering, and management teams (**cross-functional teams**) to define maintenance requirements, implement upgrades, and ensure seamless operational efficiency.
*   **Problem-Solving in High-Pressure Environments:** Consistently demonstrated superior **problem-solving** and decision-making skills to resolve critical equipment failures under intense time pressure, mirroring the rapid iteration and bug-fixing required in software development.
*   **Process Optimization:** Used data-driven analysis of equipment performance to propose and implement preventative maintenance strategies, optimizing operational processes and extending equipment lifespan.

## Software Development Projects

### 1. **Job Tracker Dashboard (React/JavaScript)**
A single-page application built with **React** to help users track job applications.

*   Developed a responsive **front-end solution** using React components and hooks to manage state and application flow.
*   Implemented dynamic data visualization for application status and interview stages, demonstrating proficiency in **modern JavaScript** and component-based architecture.
*   Utilized a mock RESTful API to simulate data fetching and state management, reinforcing knowledge of API integration.

### 2. **Automation System Simulator (Python/Web Interface)**
A project designed to simulate a simple industrial automation process with a web-based control panel.

*   Applied principles of **industrial automation** and **PLC logic** to design the simulation's underlying control flow in Python.
*   Created a simple web interface (front-end) to monitor and adjust simulation parameters, demonstrating the ability to bridge technical systems knowledge with web application presentation.
*   Showcased the ability to translate complex, real-world systems logic into a structured, programmatic solution.
