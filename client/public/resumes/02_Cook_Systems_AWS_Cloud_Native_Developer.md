## Software Development Projects

### 1. Cloud-Native Inventory Management System (AWS Focus)
*Project demonstrating proficiency in cloud-native development and full-stack implementation.*

*   Developed a full-stack web application using **React** and **Node.js/Express.js** to manage industrial inventory and maintenance logs.
*   Deployed the application using **AWS** services, including **EC2** for hosting, **S3** for static asset storage, and **RDS (PostgreSQL)** for the database, demonstrating foundational **cloud-native application** development and deployment.
*   Designed the data model and implemented **RESTful APIs** for data exchange, including handling **XML** data for legacy system integration, directly addressing job requirements.
*   Utilized **Git** for version control and practiced **SCRUM Agile** principles throughout the development lifecycle.

### 2. Automated Diagnostic Tool (Python/Automation Focus)
*Project highlighting the translation of automation experience into code-based solutions.*

*   Created a **Python** script to automate the diagnostics and logging of system errors for a simulated industrial machine.
*   The script mimics the **logical flow and state-checking** inherent in **PLC programming**, translating real-world automation logic into modern programming structures.
*   Used Python libraries to process log files and generate structured reports, demonstrating skills in data handling and system analysis.
*   Emphasized **problem-solving** by designing a robust, error-handling mechanism to ensure the reliability of the diagnostic output.
